    <br>
    I grew up in the town of Yufu, Oita prefecture Japan, surrounded by beautiful scenery and nature, close to the Sky. When I was a child, my town was called a Village, almost all families were/are rice and vegetable farmers, and they also used to raise cows and chickens for their families to eat. What we needed to buy was only fish. Nature was my friend and we chatted a lot. As I was growing up, sometimes  Naturre the just listened to me and understood who I am, and gave me much comfort. 

We all are the same as humans just as others are the same, like trees rocks, all the things surround us in our life and nature. We help and support each other when we can. We are living together on this planet Mother Earth, but she is also our friend. Join me in blessing and appreciating nature. 

This website is based on my feelings about life, I will be writing more later, but first I wanted to introduce you to part of my town, Yufu and Beppu, Oita prefecture where you can visit and stay to receive the benefit of Nature and experience your true-self!

      <h2>Hells of Beppu</h2>
      <p>Beppu Onsen on Oita's east coast, is one of the most famous hot spring towns in Japan. It produces more hot
        spring
        water than any other place in the country,
        and the view of the townscape with plumes of rising steam is striking. Beppu is especially famous for its
        “hells,”
        (jigoku),
        hot springs that reach over 100 degrees Celsius. Although they are too hot to soak in, each has a different
        character.

        The hells are located in the hills north of the main town; five in the Kannawa District and two in the Shibaseki
        District.
        Within the districts, you can walk to the other nearby hells, but the two areas are 3km apart, so most people
        bus
        or
        drive between them.
        The most beautiful hell is Umi Jigoku, or “Sea Hell,” a pool of milky blue water, shrouded in steam. The grounds
        also feature a large garden with
        several smaller, orange-colored hells.

        Another spectacular hell is Chinoike Jigoku or “Blood Pond Hell”, which is bright red, thanks to the high levels
        of
        iron and magnesium in the water.
        You can have lunch at Kamado Jigoku, (Cooking Pot Hell), where you can cook a basket of eggs and vegetables in
        the
        hot spring's steam.</p>

      <h2>Kujyu Flower Park</h2>

      <p>This large park is located at the base of the Kuju Mountains in western Oita Prefecture, a short drive from
        Kurokawa Onsen and Mt. Aso.
        It features more than 500 different varieties of flowers and plants, creating colorful carpets of flowers across
        the hills, in every season except for deepest winter. In summer, you can pick blueberries. In autumn, the park has a flower
        festival, with fields of cosmos and flame-hued celosia.

        The park grounds include a greenhouse for tropical plants, and several giftshops selling local souvenirs, plants
        and flower-themed crafts.
        You can bring your own food to eat in the gardens, or try the restaurants, cafes, and casual food stalls,
        throughout the park. In summer,
        farmers from the area often sell their produce at the garden’s entrance. <a

    <h2>Usa Shrine</h2>
    <p>Located at the base of the Kunisaki Peninsula, the Usa Shrine in Kyushu Island acts as the head shrine among 40,000
      branches
      in Japan dedicated to the Shinto God of Archery and War known as Hachiman.
      The Divine deity is heavily associated with the legendary Emperor Ojin of Japan. Built over 1300 years ago,
      the Usa Shrine is a major contributing factor in the formation of the mountain worship religion, special in
      the area around the Kunisaki Peninsula known as Rokugo Manzan culture. The shrine consists of many structures
      including a treasure hall,
      ceremonial grounds, several ponds separated by an upper and bottom complex of the area. The main hall of Usa Shrine
      is designated as a National
      Treasure of Japan with the unique style of Hachiman zukuri architectural building style, which is applied by
      combining roofs of two different
      structures to form into one large building. Local shops provide visitors with souvenirs by the road leading up to
      the north entrance.
      The treasure hall houses cultural artifacts related to the shrine many of which are designated as national
      treasures.
      Around 150 festivals are celebrated at this shrine throughout the year including seasonal celebrations for luck and
      harvest.
      The Usa Mikoshi Festival or Summer Festival is one of the largest festivals celebrated at this location which
      consists of mikoshi
      floats attracting thousands of locals and foreign visitors to attend each year. </p>

    <h2>Ootsuru Bridge</h2>
  </div>
  <img src="bridge.JPG" alt="square" height="400" width="600" style="float:right;margin: 20px" />

  <p>Want to feel like your seeing Kyushu from the air without ever actually leaving the ground? Make your way to the
    Kokonoe Yume Grand
    Suspension Bridge just north of the Kuju mountain range in western Oita prefecture.

    The bridge seems to float over the forested valley below, constructed at an impressive 777 meters off the ground. It
    is 390 meters
    long to cross from one side to the other, and takes on average twenty minutes to cross. These stats make it the
    longest and highest
    pedestrian suspension bridge in the world and as such, it offers spectacular views. From the center of the bridge,
    you can see two
    waterfalls, one of which is listed on Japan's 100 most famous waterfalls list. In autumn, the gorge here is awash in
    fall colors
    and this is a favorite spot for leaf-peepers in Kyushu.

    At the ends of the bridge, keep your eyes peeled for two unique shrines. The "white snake shrine" commemorates five
    snakes,
    all of whom attempted to ascend to heaven. Only three reached their goal, while the other two were turned into the
    nearby dual
    waterfall seen from the bridge. The "white bird shrine", whose origins are a bit mistier, allegedly dates back 1500
    years.

    The bridge is designed to hold 1,800 people, though for some visitors, the slight sway caused by that number of feet
    on the bridge

    deck may be a bit too much if you're prone to vertigo! The bridge actually aims to attract 300,000 visitors per
    year, a number that
    it smashed in its inaugural year (2006) in only the first four weeks!

    There are parking areas on either side of the bridge, although the western parking lot offers both more spaces and
    more diversions.
    You can chow down on a local Kokonoe beef burger or grab some of the other snacks on offer. A local tourism office
    here can help you for
    journeys in and around the area. There are numerous local onsen in which to soak any travel-weary bones, while
    hikers and nature lovers are only
    a short drive from the trails of the Kuju Range and the Tadewara Wetlands.

    <div>Toriten or chicken tempura is now a dish that represents Oita prefecture. It was first created at this shop.
      This restaurant opened in 1927. The creator of this dish eventually cooked for royalty.
      This dish was created taking a hint from Chinese cuisine to cut the tougher chicken in a thin manner and put it in
      tempura batter to fry. Before it had a much more elaborate name fit for royalty.
      Now only thigh meat is used and it is seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and sesame oil. Eggs that day and the
      freshest flours are also used to create this dish.
      The specialty sauce and spice made by this shop is the perfect match for you to use in your desired amounts. Come
      for lunch to enjoy your toriten with a Chinese style bowl of rice!
      The volume of the meal is plenty with rice, soup, and salad. Come here when you come to Beppu!

  <img src="pudding3.png" alt="square" height="300" width="400" style="vertical-align:text-top; float:left; margin: 20px" />


  <div>The Jigoku-mushi Purin, or “hell-steamed custard pudding,” is so devilishly delicious that it topped the list in
    a nationwide survey on which local creme caramels people most want to buy.
    The dessert is cooked in the steam of hot spring water that is available at the Myoban onsen resort in Beppu, Oita
    Prefecture.
    “Its bitter caramel sauce and rich flavor (of the custard) are addictive, while it is slightly firm like traditional
    ones,
    ” according to the Jalan travel information magazine.
    The magazine, published by Tokyo-based Recruit Lifestyle Co., conducted a survey in February to pay tribute to
    “Purin Day,
    ” which falls on the 25th of every month and is registered by the Japan Anniversary Association.
    The online survey asked 1,046 people in their 20s through 50s in the nation’s 47 prefectures which creme caramel
    they most desired.
    Of them, 29.2 percent said they want to order the Jigoku-mushi Purin sold by the Okamotoya Baiten shop.
    The Nakahora Bokujo Purin from Iwate Prefecture came in second, followed by the Shima Purin from Okinawa Prefecture
    and the Zenkoji Purin from Nagano Prefecture.
    “(Custard puddings) are drawing increased attention. At least 70 percent of the respondents said if they come across
    locally made creme caramels in sightseeing destinations, they would love to try them,” a Jalan representative said.
    “The Jigoku-mushi Purin from Beppu is especially beloved for its simple but rich taste that is achieved when it is
    cooked in the steam rising from the natural hot spring,” the representative added. </div>
